Blockchain based distributed ledgers is one of the most studied research areas, owing to the enormous success of crypto-currencies like Bitcoin, Etherium, etc. But, in addition to all the advantages, Blockchain is by design resource intensive and in general does not scale well. Hence, researchers all over are looking for alternatives for blockchain and one such alternative is the Tangle, introduced by IOTA foundation. Tangle is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based distributed ledger, which boasts advantages like high scalability and support for micro-payments. But outside the context of IOTA, the properties of a DAG-based distributed ledger are not studied. Also IOTA currently does not contain a large scale peer-to-peer simulation system with configurable parameters, which allows the users to study the important characteristics and metrics of the network and compare di erent scenarios under controlled conditions. This thesis proposes CIDDS, a Configurable and Interactive DAG based Distributed ledger Simulation framework as a solution to this problem. Using CIDDS, users can create large scale tangle simulations with thousands of nodes and study the characteristics of the resulting DAG ledgers with varying parameters.
